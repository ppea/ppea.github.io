    **Progress:** [✅]

    **Comments:** Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. (Kinda of obseleted. When I study this course, it is based on Matlab/Octave. Now the remake version is based on Python.)

    **Progress:** [✅]

    **Contents**: 5 courses

    - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
    - Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
    - Structuring Machine Learning Projects
    - Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Sequence Models

    **Comments:** 🏆 Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera, almost everything about deep learning is covered in this specialization. Well-rounded and highly recommended, if you have enough time.

-   :fontawesome-brands-square-github:{ .lg .middle } __Dive Into Deep Learning 🏆__

    --- 

    **Status:** [✅ Finished 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,18] [🚧 Ongoing 17]

    **Comments:** A very good book for deep learning beginners. It is free and open source. It is also available in Chinese. The book is still under development, but it is already very good. Highly recommended.
